This Python script provides a simple yet powerful financial calculator that enables users to choose between two different types of financial calculations: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

Features
Investment Calculator: Calculate the total amount of an investment over a specified time period with either simple or compound interest.
Home Loan Repayment Calculator: Calculate the monthly repayment amount for a home loan based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and the repayment period in months.
Usage
Upon running the program, users are presented with two options:

investment: To calculate the future value of an investment given the principal amount, interest rate, time, and interest type (simple or compound).
bond: To calculate the monthly repayment amount on a home loan.
How to Use
For Investment Calculations:

Choose investment when prompted.
Enter the principal amount (the initial amount of money you are investing).
Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage).
Enter the number of years you plan on investing.
Specify the interest type: simple or compound.
The program will then display the total amount after the specified period.
For Bond Repayments:

Choose bond when prompted.
Enter the present value of the house (the principal loan amount).
Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage).
Enter the number of months over which you plan to repay the bond.
The program will calculate and display the monthly repayment amount.
Requirements
This script uses the math module for mathematical operations, so ensure your Python environment includes this standard library (which is included in standard Python installations).
